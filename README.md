<h1>Create a Resource Group in Azure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple Bash script that walks the user through creating a new resource group in Azure. The Bash script will install the Azure CLI and make a connection between the local CLI and the Azure portal. Then the Bash script will print out a list of the recommended regions and allow you to choose which region to create the resource group. The Bash script will then prompt the user to select a name for the resource group. After checking if the resource group already exists, the resource group will be created.
